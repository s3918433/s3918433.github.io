<!-- In this assignment, i decided to picked a prompt of portfolio. Since it is a
portfolio i am flexible to create what i want and how i would want my website to
achieve; i wanted it to represent me. I was greatly inspired by my Ipad's
wallpaper where apple just released their new astronology wallpaper and theres a
planet Mars which in the ipad looked pink. I feel inlove with the wallpaper
immediately and wanted to use the colour pallete and aesthetic. I wanted users
to have a easy navigation and have fun when interacting my website. So i made
the layout as simple and straightforward as possible so text-savy and non-text
savy users could understand what is going on and knows how to operate! -->

<!-- I ended up doing hover: change colour, hover: scaling, clicking: stars and the
slide show. All inspired by 2 interactive portfolio webpage:
https://www.guts.agency/ and https://kkapustin.com/ -->

        <!-- this is a 3d model i created in blender and animate it myself, this is
        to recreate my wallpaper look; i animate it aswell as the planet spins
        and the light; to give more of a nice effect, like theres something. I
        was inspired by Kapustin's webiste where the keyboard was there, when i
        was going through his webpage; i looked at it in a ipad where whenever i
        press the screen the crosshair pointer changed based on where i pressed.
        hence why i made the stars effect where whenever users enters my page,
        they can add stars around the planet. It fits the aesthetic as it is a
        planet and added stars in it and also it's interactive for users to play
        with -->

        <!-- i had trouble making the text going on top of the video since the text
        was behind it, i asked ChatGPT to help me and they told me to create a
        seperate div and name it overlay. I did not want to say it like 'click
        me to get stars' or a sentence that state what users should do, i wanted
        to word it out super metaphorically but not hard enough that people do
        not understand what to do -->
