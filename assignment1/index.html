            The scribbled animated abstract lines that go across the webpage
            caught my attention, as they are the first thing you'll see when
            viewing the page. It makes you wait for it to finish drawing,
            curious about what they are scribbling and what they are making. It
            will then lead you to the introduction page, where it automatically
            animated the big word ‘Sculpting Harmony', which is designed for
            users to be ‘attracted’ to it. That way, it leads them to hover
            their mouse over or even click on it as they want to know ‘what does
            it do’. Otherwise, the stretch animation makes you want to scroll
            down and see what’s to come.

          <h3>
            “What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
            with?’’
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most of the mediums that i spend time engaging on are the 3D models,
            the background effect, the ‘Sculpting Harmony’ section, the music
            and the videos.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>3D models:</strong> The designers have posted 3D models of
              the Walt Disney Concert Hall, which I think are quite entertaining
              and appealing to play with. It contains both the model's sketches
              and the finale. I liked how I could view the models in 360
              degrees, including zooming in to see the details and out to
              appreciate the product from a broader viewpoint.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The background effect:</strong> the background that
              animates the screen whenever I scroll down is the interactive
              experience that I spend the most time with. It animates the screen
              every time I scroll down, as if I were seeing the building from a
              drone at my own pace. I find it incredibly satisfying to play with
              because I am constantly switching back and forth to see how it
              flows neatly over my screen.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>‘Sculpting Harmony’:</strong> The designers created this
              area so that when users hover their mouse, it generates a word
              that leads to their story and appears dependent on how they move
              their mouse. I think it is extremely creative and artistic since
              it is another method to convey a narrative. I spend more time
              reading the story and toying with the result. I enjoy playing with
              it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Music:</strong> I've spent more time admiring the music
              while lazily scrolling over the site. The music that the designers
              included on the website made the experience more immersive as if
              you were in the concert hall itself. It gave the website a feel
              that conveys to the user what type of performance hall they are.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Videos:</strong> I spent more time viewing the interview
              video than reading the website's paragraph material. Because I am
              not the type of person who enjoys reading, I will spend more time
              learning while viewing the documentary. Furthermore, I find the
              subtitles appealing to look at while watching the interview; their
              opacity increases while the interviewee speaks in the video, as
              opposed to a standard subtitle, which has no effects.

            “What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with
            the experience?’’
          </h3>
          <p>
            In my two minutes, the most common action is to toy around with the
            interactive parts from the website; The background effect and the
            ‘Sculpturing Harmony’ section. I find both mediums to be incredibly
            entertaining and satisfying to play with.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The background effect:</strong> The captivating background
              effect, which features the Walt Disney Concert Hall building that
              resembles drone footage, is the medium I played the most than the
              ‘Sculptering Harmony’ effect. As I scroll down, the background
              moves, simulating drone-like movement, and when I scroll up, the
              background seems to rewind, creating a unique and immersive
              browsing experience. I spend a lot of time on this part because I
              enjoy experimenting with the animation; it's fun to play with.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>‘Sculpturing Harmony’ section:</strong> This section drew
              my attention right away, and I spent the majority of my two-minute
              interactive experience playing in it. When I hover the mouse over
              the large font, the words appear as I move, creating a story. I
              read the brief paragraphs and toyed with the effect; I like how
              they appear when I move the mouse.

          <h3>
            “What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
            interactive experience?’’
          </h3>
          <p>
            My impression is that the intended audience for this website is
            design historians, researchers, architects, students studying
            architecture, and architectural enthusiasts, particularly in the
            range of teenagers to adults in their mid-30s. This assumption is
            based on how imaginative and artistic the web design is; it aims to
            draw in young users to visit the interactive websites and learn
            about the building. As a result, the website contains a variety of
            mediums (video, music, 3D, and effects), preventing it from becoming
            monotonous. Their user experience is designed for website-savvy
            individuals.

        </span>

      <div class="container">
        <span class="question">
          <h3>
            “How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?”
          </h3>
          <p>
            I believe the primary goal is to teach users about the historical
            building, not just how it was created but also about its context;
            why was the building built? Why is it known as the 'Walt Disney
            Concert Hall'? Why was it built in a certain way? What kind of music
            do they play in the concert hall? Etc. The designers successfully
            communicated these goals without having to design in a traditional
            form, instead using interactive media such as 3D models, films, and
            music.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>3D:</strong>The use of 3D models allows designers to
              portray the building from a variety of angles and perspectives,
              which is very useful for international visitors or those who have
              never seen it. By zooming in and out, viewers may have a more
              immersive and detailed perspective of the building, giving them a
              better sense of how it looks. This successfully communicated the
              primary purpose by improving their users' visualisations,
              demonstrating a more detailed and immersive representation of the
              subject than typical 2D images.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Video:</strong>The use of video showcased a taped
              interview with architect Frank Gehry. He was asked questions about
              the music hall's development process and explained why he chose
              certain features for the hall. Not only is this an enjoyable way
              to learn about the building, but it also allows viewers to connect
              with him. Understand the deeper meaning of why he designed the
              structure in that way. It appears that they saw this building as
              art, which is why the filmed video revealed the deeper meaning of
              why they built it that way.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sound:</strong>When visitors enter the webpage, they will
              be greeted by music. The classical music that replays and changes
              as you scroll down to the next chapters reveals what kind of music
              was played in the Walt Disney Concert Hall. This medium may
              enhance the interactive experience by allowing users to be 'in the
              mood' or experience nostalgia, as classical music frequently
              conveys a feeling of history. With this medium included in the
              website, the designers have successfully communicated their
              primary objectives.

          <h3>
            “What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
            with over time?” (For how long and how many different times?)
          </h3>
          <p>
            After playing around with the website for a while, I find myself
            skipping past the informative sections; paragraphs, and videos. I
            ended up jumping to the interactive section that I enjoy; the
            'Sculpturing Harmony' section, and the background effect. As someone
            who is not interested in architecture or structures, I find the
            website boring except for the interactive mediums; nonetheless, I do
            not read the text and instead play with it. This is my impression.
            In my view, users who visit the website for no reason may only visit
            once because there is nothing else to look at (just like me). For
            example, if you have already visited a museum, why should you return
            to the same museum with the same content? I believe that those who
            are interested in the building and want to learn more about it will
            find the interaction, such as the 3D models and interviewed videos,
            which can be useful for them and may return to it as a reference.

      <div class="container">
        <span class="question">
          <h3>
            "How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
            interacted with over time?''
          </h3>
          <p>
            The interactive medium is a very artistic and creative way of
            presenting information. The website does not display itself in a
            monotonous manner, as everything on this webpage can catch the
            users' attention. Visitors who have no intention of returning may
            skip the educational segment and instead play with the interactive
            parts until they become bored and leave. Again, it's similar to
            visiting a museum; why return when you've already seen the displays?
          </p>
          <p>
            However, users with specific purposes, such as UX designers, UI
            designers, architectural researchers, and architecture students, may
            return to the site. This is because the website contains many unique
            and interesting elements. For example, architecture students who
            want to examine the building in greater detail may use 3D models as
            a reference instead of a 2D image, allowing them to analyse the
            building from all angles. Users who work in UX/UI can visit the
            website for inspiration, to study how the website works, and to see
            how the designers uniquely presented their material; it can be used
            as a reference.

            The animated abstract is the other media forms that experience
            reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            The animated abstract that appears at the beginning of each chapter
            is the design of the building itself: the Walt Disney Concert Hall
            structure, the interior, and the organ. The fact that they are
            animated mimics how the architecture draws these sketches, which was
            a great addition to the experience.

            This reference indicates that the webpage should be dealt with in a

            of building the concert hall, from sketches to the finished product.
            It tells a story. When viewing the website, users should interact
            with it as if it were a contemporary art museum; if you glare at or
            screen it quickly, you will think it is just a building; if you
            admire it, read it, and spend your time with it, it is more than
            that.

          <p>
            As previously said, the web experience is similar to that of
            visiting a contemporary art gallery. Using museum terminology, the
            interviewed movies may be the videos that are presented in the
            museum, the 3D models are the three-dimensional artworks, the audio
            acts as background music that sets the ambience, similar to ambient
            sounds in museums, the photographs may serve as portraits, and the
            paragraphs may act as the piece's description.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users may experience feelings of amazement, inspiration, curiosity,
            and appreciation when viewing the website, much as they would in a
            museum. Capable of understanding why the building was made, designed
            the way it is, why it was built, and how much effort the architects
            put into the historical structure.

          <p>
            I do not find the website entirely frustrating, however, there are
            tiny problems that I find excruciatingly irritating.

              it is a habit of mine to automatically click the space button or
              the screen to pause the video, however, this feature did not work
              when I wanted to pause/play the interview video. I find it
              annoying when I have to drag my mouse to the pause/play button.

              the use of fonts from the first letter of the paragraph does catch
              my attention, however, it may cause viewers to read it wrongly.
              For example the designers made the letter ‘L’ from ‘Late’
              incredibly big, bold, and different, which led me to read the
              first letter of the paragraph, ‘ate’. This design confuses me.

              <strong>The sound;</strong> I wish there was a transition as you
              scrolled to the next portion of the website. I did a test where I
              scrolled down the website quickly, and it had a 'fade in/fade out'
              transition (which I didn't notice until I closely examined it
              again). It irritates me because the song reflects the atmosphere,
              and it varies very quickly, which I dislike and find annoying.
              Each song has its own unique music, and they all create a
              different mood; one will be peaceful, while the next will be
              dramatic. I think it would be better if they had a 'middle song'
              that gradually transitions to the next mood so that the user is
              not overwhelmed.

            makes that part satisfying?”
          </h3>
          <p>
            I find all of the interactions on this website to be incredibly
            satisfying due to how smooth and well-put the website is. From the
            highlighted features to the tiny details, I love how well-designed
            this website is.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Scrolling;</strong> The animation and how the graphics
              expand/stretch are satisfyingly smooth when scrolling down the
              webpage. This effect fits perfectly well with the website, and it
              is a tiny detail that would feel 'missing’ or ‘empty’ without it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>'Sculpturing Harmony' section;</strong> When I hover my
              cursor over the large text, it is really satisfying and
              entertaining to play with because of how fluid the writing
              develops as I move my mouse. I play in this section a lot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Navigation bar:</strong> The animation of the text when
              hovering over the navigation bar is strangely visually appealing.
              The effects complement the website's tone; they are neither
              overpowering nor lacking in anything, and could admire them all
              day long.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Introduction page:</strong> When just hovering the mouse
              left and right, the illustration and the text move in the same
              direction as your mouse. Nothing is lacking or being exaggerated
              when interacting with it. As before, I find it satisfying because
              these small things can make such a significant difference in
              making the website more complete.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The background effect:</strong> As we scroll around Walt’s
              building, it smoothly animates the building based on how fast we
              scroll. I found it satisfying, as it flowed very smoothly whenever
              I re-interacted with the model.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tiny details:</strong> The designer designed the website
              with details, which I think it would lack without them. The simple
              added effects, details, and animation made the interactive website
              almost perfect; it feels complete when interacting with it. Ig:
              The car moves as well whenever I scroll the 3D model, the abstract
              graphic flows slightly, which makes the website feel more ‘alive’
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Subtitles:</strong> In every documented video, there will
              be subtitles where they would show you the words that will come
              out next, like a karaoke lyric. I found that very useful and oddly
              pleasing to view. Especially when the architect, Frank Gehry,
              speaks quite slowly, it does not convey to me what he wants to say
              next because I can read the following words that he will say in
              the subtitles
