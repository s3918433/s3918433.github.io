<!-- In this assignment i have decided to create a study website where users could use the website and enjoy lofi music while having personal to-do list on the right hand. 
  they are able to control the video aswell by muting and pausing the video. -->

<!-- I incorperated a Live-streaming layout where the chat live stream replaced as the to-do list. 
  So i made a main container to placed both my video and my todo list and create another 2 seperated container for the video and to-do list. -->

<!-- the video container has the media player, which is the lofi video and the video controls. 
  that way when users expand and shrink the buttons are still placed under the video, i think this is more neater this way and more of a common mindset as where the controls should be, 
  users will always think that the control pannel will be in the below of the video hence why i placed it there -->

<!-- I want to make it as simple, comfortable, usefull as possible when users want to do a study session. Hence why i placed: 

  Time: to let users know the current time of the day, keep track of the time 

  To-do list: allows users to keep track what things they need to do, the todo list has functions of checking; mimics the real to-do-list note where it will cross out the task, and deleting the task if the task is not needed anymore

  Pause and Play button: I want the users to have a control over the website, so if they want to pause the lofi-music, they could 

  Mute and Unmute button: some users does not like music or think it could be distracting, they can choose to mute the lofi-music

  Lofi-video player: I wanted a custom video player that serves the mood of the webpage, so i downloaded the lofi video and credit. 
  for this assignment, i cut it down to 1 minute as i am afraid more than that would caused the website to crash since i downloaded the video and placed it in the code insteading to extracting it in a webpage. 
  hence i decided to loop it to mimics those live studying lofi session that you find in youtube.

  I have also decided to make the video to autoplay as i want the users to feel as welcomed as possibe when entering the webpage to study -->

<!-- That is all i have! hope this is cute and nice enough :) -->
